    question: "What is HappyPods and what problems does it solve?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          HappyPods is a mini grants platform designed for small, fast, and simple funding scenarios. It addresses long approval cycles, opaque fund distribution, and high participation barriers by streamlining the end-to-end flow from application to payout.

          <li>Optimized for micro-grants and rapid MVP validation</li>

    question: "Who are the core roles in the system?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>There are three key roles with clearly defined responsibilities and permissions:</p>
        <ul className="pl-6 space-y-1 list-disc">
          <li><strong>Grants Pool Owner (GP Owner)</strong>: Creates/manages funding pools, sets RFPs, reviews applications, and manages funds.</li>
          <li><strong>Pod Applicant</strong>: Submits proposals, defines milestones/deliverables, and executes the project.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform Admin</strong>: Neutral third party for dispute resolution; holds multi-sig rights only for exceptional cases.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

  {
    question: "How does the end-to-end funding flow work?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <ol className="pl-6 space-y-1 list-decimal">
          <li><strong>Preparation</strong>: Complete profile, choose an RFP, design 1‚Äì3 milestones with clear scope, deadlines, and budgets (typically 100‚Äì500 USDT each).</li>
          <li><strong>Review & Wallet Setup</strong>: A 3-party Safe{'{'}Wallet{'}'} is created (GP Owner, Admin, Applicant) with a 2-of-3 threshold.</li>
          <li><strong>Funding</strong>: Upon approval, GP Owner deposits the total approved amount into the multi-sig.</li>
          <li><strong>Execution</strong>: Applicant delivers according to milestones and submits proofs.</li>
          <li><strong>Disbursement</strong>: After milestone approval, funds are released via multi-sig execution.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

  {
    question: "Why multi-signature (multi-sig) and what is the threshold?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          Funds are secured using Safe{'{'}Wallet{'}'} multi-sig with a 2/3 threshold among GP Owner, Admin, and Applicant. This prevents unilateral control and creates an auditable trail for every transaction.
        </p>

    question: "Which networks and tokens are currently supported?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          The current version supports USDT on the Optimism network for grant disbursement. Multi-chain and additional token support are on the roadmap.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How are milestones reviewed and funds released?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          Applicants submit milestone deliverables with verifiable artifacts (links, docs, or other proofs). The GP Owner reviews for scope alignment, quality, and completeness. Upon approval, a multi-sig transaction is co-signed and executed to release the milestone payment.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What if a milestone delivery is delayed?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          Applicants may request deadline extensions with reasonable justification. The GP Owner evaluates and approves based on project context. In case of severe delays, the GP Owner may initiate project termination per policy.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a milestone fails review multiple times?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          Each milestone can be resubmitted up to three times upon rejection. If the same milestone fails more than three times, the project is automatically terminated and the remaining funds are returned to the GP Owner via multi-sig.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How are disputes handled?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          The Platform Admin acts as a neutral third party in the multi-sig. In disputes between the GP Owner and the Applicant, the Admin may intervene to facilitate resolution and ensure fair handling according to platform policy.
        </p>
