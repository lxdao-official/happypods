            <p className="text-lg">
              Happy Pods is a decentralized platform designed to connect contributors with projects they are passionate about. We solve the core problems of trust and efficiency in distributed collaboration. By forming 'Pods,' teams can work together on specific goals, apply for funding from 'Grants Pools,' and manage their resources transparently. Our mission is to create a sustainable ecosystem for public goods and open-source innovation.

              <li><strong>Approval & Funding:</strong> If the proposal is approved, the funds are transferred to the Pod's dedicated multi-signature wallet.</li>
